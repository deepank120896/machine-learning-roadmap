##### Steps to be followed while starting a Machine Learning Project
---

[x] Analyse The Problem
- What is final goal of ML algorithm?
  - Create something?
  - Predict something?
  - Recommend something ?

[x] Data Collection
- What datasets to be used?
- Where to get? 
- Data to train ML model

[x] Data Cleaning
- Clean datasets
- Remove unrelated data

[x] Data Selection 
- Pick only required data from datasets for model

[x] Pick a model
- What algorithm to use?
- What are pros and cons? 
- How Model will solve problem?

[x] Train/Test Model
- Feed Selected Data
- Validate Accuracy 
- REPEAT
